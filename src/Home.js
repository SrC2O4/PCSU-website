                <p> The Pharmaceutical Chemistry Student Union (PCSU) is a 
                    student-run organization dedicated to supporting undergraduate students 
                    registered in the specialist program. First established by students in 2008, 
                    PCSU is continuously evolving to provide resources and enhance studentsâ€™ 
                    university experience, in the forms of class help sessions, academic and career-path 
                    seminars, and athletic and social events. Additionally, the PCSU acts as a liaison 
                    for open communication between students and faculty. Any student registered in the 
                    Pharmaceutical Chemistry program is automatically a member of PCSU, while the team 
                    of executive members who lead PCSU are elected annually by the student body.</p>
