                  Pharmaceutical Chemistry specialist program offers an interdisciplinary study of 
                 various fields of science. Topics include fundamental knowledge for drug discovery,
                  design and all the biological aspects crucial to drug action and metabolism. In fact,
                   the program name is a bit of a misnomer, because there are only a few required chemistry
                    courses.
